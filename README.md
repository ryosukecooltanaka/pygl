# Memo
PyOpenGL is apparently not particularly well maintained
The version distributed from anaconda has a bug in glGenTextures
Had to download unofficial builds of pyopengl and pyopengl_accelerate from
https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyopengl
and install using ```pip install (.whl file name)```
